# How to create your own Chatbot in Python

I guess today, in the year 2025 it's easier than ever to create your own Chatbot.

There are a lot of ready-to-use Solutions. But making your own Chatbot would teach you how LLMs Work and give you deeper insights how the Technology actually works. 

There are different Levels and approaches on Building an Chatbot. They range in difficuly and resources needed to complete the task.

1. Easy
  Use LLM API like ChatGPT or Claude or Already made LLM model like LLama, Mistral or Gemini Nano and integrate it with a Boilerplate Example Frontend UI
2. Medium
   Use already made LLM model like LLama, Mistral or Gemini Nano, fine-tune it and integrate it with a given Frontend UI

  Use Gemini Nano integrated inside Google Canary and build Frontend UI by yourself. 
4. Hard
   Create LLM Model from Scratch and Build your own Frontend UI (Needs a lot of resources and time to complete)

Python LLM Chatbot 

yes, fine-tunning with own data and using ChatGPT API, using latent spaces and adding Context to the Model. Also some stuff on Integration with LangChain and Vercel SDK https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction

If you install Chrome Canary and enable experimental features you could even get small Gemin Nano in the Browser (20 Giga) But the model is very Weak to be honest xD
